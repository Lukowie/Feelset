# Feelset
Next.js - React - Mysql CRUD Application to receive music submissions



#Notes for me
Approve/ Deny functionality
Queue system to keep track of what I am approving and denying. Already passing the row of submission's id through json.. should be possible.
Then comes the WINSCP script and the Powershell script to run the After Effects automated editing script.

Will need to do extensive testing.
